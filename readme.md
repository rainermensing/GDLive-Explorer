This is the codebase for a [dashboard](https://share.streamlit.io/rainermensing/gdlive-explorer/main/streamlit.py) build while completing Pipeline Data Engineering Academy. The idea had been on my mind for a long before though, and I had also already built parts of the scraper. The bootcamp was the opportunity for me to turn it into a presentable project. However, please note that this is still work in progress. I am still to add the orchestration tool and also plan to dockerize it. The scraper is currently run manually, as I am still debugging. I will also add a more elaborate documentation on how I went about this project, soon.
I am planning to add new features as I have time, for example a NLP module using Flair that analyzes sentiment. Please feel free to reach out to me at rainer.mensing@hotmail.de for any questions or suggestions.
